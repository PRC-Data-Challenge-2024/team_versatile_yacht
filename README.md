# PRC Data Challenge 2024

This repository contains the code of [team_versatile_yacht](https://ansperformance.eu/study/data-challenge/teams.html#team_versatile_yacht) used for the [PRC Data Challenge 2024](https://ansperformance.eu/study/data-challenge/)

## The Team
The team is composed of aeronautical engineers and data scientist

## The approach
### Feature engineering
We have built different features from the data provided
- Trajectory based features
  - First stable fl after take-off
  - Average climb rate till that stable fl
  - Average ground speed
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Airspeed and direction
- non-trajectory based features
  - aircraft type
  - ADEP/ADES
  - Distance flown
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the year

We build features to take into account non-linearities in the relationship between TOW and features, for instance:
- Square of speed
- Square root of speed
- sine and cosine of hour of the day: This allows having continuous variables representing the time
- sine and cosine of day of the year: This allows having continuous variables representing the day
- sine and cosine of track and windspeed angle

 
### Model testing
We have tested different models:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- ANN
- RF
- Gradient Boost
It comes out that the best performance is achieved with a random forest, this is the one retained.
 
## Usage
### Configuration
Configuration is based on env variables:
- SOURCE_FOLDER: folder with the .parquet and .csv files provided by the PRC Challenge
- DESTINATION_FOLDER: folder where the temporary data has to be stored
- CHALLENGE_FILE: Name of the PRC Challenge file with the challenge set
- CHALLENGE_FILE_PREPROC: Name of the temporary file used for adding features to the challenge set
- SUBMISSION_FILE:  Name of the PRC Challenge file with the submission set
- SUBMISSION_FILE_PREPROC: Name of the temporary file used for adding features to the submission set
- AIRCRAFT_DB: Name of csv file with aircraft performance data (provided)
- TRAJECTORY_DATA: Name of csv file with post-processing of trajectory (generated by trajectory_processing_00.py)
- UTC_OFFSET: File with local UTC offset
### Execution
1. Run the trajectory_processing_00.py file: This can take significant time as it will cycle through the .parquet files
2. Run the add_features.ipynb notebook: This will increment the challenge and submission set with additional features
3. Run the rf_model.ipynb notebook: This will test a Random Forest Model and generate the TOW for the submission set
